# HUSKITOPIA
## the ~~best~~ MOST EPICEST society you can live in (maybe)

here's a list of various stuff that relies on huskitopian technology!  
currently that's just the huskitopian time server, but maybe more in the future (:

- **[ht_web](https://github.com/floppydiskette/ht_web)** - website that shows the current time and a websocket relay for the time server (live at https://huskitopia.org) [ğŸ•’]
- **[ht_ledger](https://github.com/floppydiskette/ht_ledger)** - ledger for huskitopian time server, records seconds elapsed per day since the beginning of time [ğŸ•’]
- **[ht_timeparser](https://github.com/floppydiskette/ht_timeparser)** - rust crate for parsing huskitopian date strings (e.g. 0000-GZ-05) [ğŸ•’]
- **[ht_cal](https://github.com/floppydiskette/ht_cal)** - THE TIME SERVER >:3 [ğŸ•’ğŸ§±]
